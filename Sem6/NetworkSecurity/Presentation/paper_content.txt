1. Introduction

An introduction is provided to cover the importance of Endpoint Detection and Response technology in today’s cyber
security contexts. Indeed, the introduction consists of information on the dynamic threats cape, characterized by tough and
persistent cyber-attacks, most of which target endpoints. Thus, with an increase in the number of endpoint devices and the
tough nature of cyber threats, strong endpoint security solutions like EDR become essential. [2]One of the most challenging
things about security is that, Action Workbench practitioners believe, should certainly come off guard, given that any other
point on the list is the difficulty such professionals have about the complexity of their context. The attack surface is not
standing still; however, it is increasing in width. The businesses use best-in-class solutions for each attack vector and
combat every single potential point of failure and therefore must use EDR. In conclusion, EDR is below the what, email,
identity, network, among others, on the stack, and then goes above it, the EDR makes decisions based on the data provided
by the EDR meaningfully across technical stacks.

2. Definition and Scope

Endpoint Security: protect against online attacks directed at endpoints, such as computers, laptops, servers, and mobile
devices. [13]A compromised network usually exposed to attackers by this method due to the ease of entry into the target
network; subsequently, attackers can steal sensitive information or disrupt regular business processes. Solutions,
specifically, are built to detect, prevent, and address an array of risks ranging from ransom ware, malware, phishing, as well
as insider threats-related to endpoints. As a result, endpoint detection and response is needed.

3. Role of EDR

Endpoint Detection and Response is a category of endpoint security products that concentrate on identifying and reacting to
the unique threats discovered on endpoints. EDR solutions are designed to give more comprehensive insight into overall
endpoint activities, monitor conducts, detect, prevent, and remediate incidents much simpler for overall detection and

response .[3]It is unlike conventional antivirus applications and endpoint protection systems, as many of these strive to take
a proactive approach. Because of better visibility from EDR, security professionals can rapidly recognize and approach
more security occurrences and worries for nearer and faster reaction as compared to conventional methods that function as a
powerful driving factor. Indeed, According to [7], EDR technology’s main concern is to detect and respond to security
threats on endpoints. They are designed to monitor endpoints in real-time continually and collect telemetry data on systemlevel events, network connections, executing processes, and file access. Moreover, endpoint log data is also observed to
comprehend more about what the target endpoint is doing, what adjustments are made, how the registry keys have changed,
etc. . By viewing this telemetry data with advanced detection capabilities like machine learning, behavioral analytics, and
threat intelligence, EDR solutions can identify suspicious activities, indicators of compromise, and security incidents on
endpoints.
3.1 Investigation & Forensics using EDR
EDR solutions offer in-depth insight into endpoint operations, allowing security analysts to delve into security breaches,
perform forensic examinations, and ascertain the origin of security incidents [9]. EDR platforms collect and retain
comprehensive endpoint data, facilitating retrospective examination of security events and reconstruction of incidents. This
forensic capability plays a pivotal role in grasping the scale and consequences of security breaches, assigning responsibility
to specific threat actors, and implementing corrective measures to forestall future occurrences. [1-14]
3.2 EDRs in Thread Hunting
Beyond merely identifying known threats and security breaches, EDR technology facilitates proactive engagement in threat
hunting endeavours. This proactive approach involves actively seeking out indications of compromise, suspicious conduct,
or markers of advanced threats that may have eluded conventional security measures. [9] EDR platforms empower security
analysts to conduct precise searches, sift through endpoint data, and pinpoint abnormal activities suggestive of potential
security breaches. Through proactive threat hunting, organizations can identify and address security vulnerabilities before
they escalate into significant incidents.

6. Top advancements in edr technology
With the rise in the number of endpoints, the volume of data requiring protection also escalates. Traditional human
oversight is insufficient without sophisticated security automation capable of predicting and thwarting attacks intelligently
[13]. Each data source possesses distinct characteristics, patterns, and interpretations, complicating the task of security
analysts who rely solely on manual examination of raw data to identify malicious threats. Consequently, prioritizing the
automation of endpoint detection and response solutions stands as a paramount concern for IT professionals. The demand
for human automation is steadily growing, particularly in the realm of discerning false positives and false negatives that
may arise from analysis.

7. Machine learning

Machine learning techniques have significantly evolved, aiding in the identification of anomalies and enhancing threat
detection across various domains. As outlined in [5][8], several key points underscore the importance of machine learning
in endpoint protection:
• Properly configured and managed, machine learning can greatly augment cyber security teams, multiplying their
effectiveness.
• Methods that use reliable processes will be especially difficult for conventional methods to recognize. Machine learning
is capable of efficiently counteracting this kind of danger. This is especially true when combined with behaviour-based
analysis.
• Machine learning is the data quality it feeds on. As outlined in [6][7][8], Machine learning lacks the ability to generate
knowledge, but it can be used to unearth knowledge from data. Machine learning is not really feasible in many
companies because they do not have an adequate amount of threat telemetry or an appropriate amount of data breadth
and depth.
• Human capacity is surpassed by machine learning's ability to grow quickly and handle enormous volumes of data. In
the case of advanced threats, when significant data analysis is required to identify trends and patterns, organizations are
just unable to manually analyse the volume of data required for efficient detections [19].
While machine learning offers the advantage of scaling and processing large volumes of data beyond human capability,
there are also notable drawbacks when employing it in EDR technology:
1.

4.

Limited Contextual Understanding: Machine learning algorithms often struggle to contextualize events within broader
security landscapes, potentially leading to false positives or missed detections, especially with novel attack vectors or
sophisticated threats [15].
High False Positive Rates: An inadequately configured ML-based EDR systems tend to produce a high rate of false
positives, classifying clean event as malicious. This may overly flood the security team with inappropriate notification,
leading to alert fatigue and perhaps diverting the team’s attention away from genuine threats.
Adversarial Manipulation: Such assaults might befall EDR systems that depend on machine learning (ML); an
adversarial attack is one in which the attacker modifies the input data to trick the algorithm and evade detection.
Techniques like data poisoning and evasion assaults have the potential to threaten the integrity and efficacy of machine
learning-based security.
Model Drift: Machine learning models may experience drift as underlying data distributions change over time. This
drift can degrade detection ability, necessitating regular retraining or recalibration to maintain efficacy in EDR
operations.

7.1 Artificial intelligence
One of the main benefits of incorporating AI in EDR is the increased ability to detect threats. Because AI and machine
learning algorithms are likely to get smarter and more successful at recognizing dangers over time as they study more data,
the threat likelihood may rise in various methods. The possibility of more breaches identified, time to detection reduced,
fewer false positives, and more accurate notifications is among the critical advantages of AI utilized for threat prevention.
For instance, “Blackberry Cylance’s AI-driven EDR” research indicated that more than 70% of participants already
included AI in their EDR plans. Additionally, AI-driven EDR systems may accelerate the timely response to threats. As
these revolutionary tools may automatically execute numerous corrective actions, they may minimize the burden on
technical tools that are already overstretched while simultaneously reducing response time [20]. For example, automation
can signal red flags that might be ignored by human examiners. Automation can also automate a list of approved and
disapproved malware and prioritized procedures, categorizing and then continually monitoring the weather for unusual
circumstances. Utilizing Artificial Intelligence in Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) technology offers numerous
benefits, revolutionizing threat detection and response capabilities. However, alongside these advantages, several significant
drawbacks must be carefully considered:

3.

https://doi.org/10.1051/e3sconf/202455601006

Complexity and Overreliance: AI-driven EDR systems often incorporate complex models and algorithms, making
them challenging to fully comprehend. Overreliance on AI may lead to a false sense of security, potentially causing
users to overlook human monitoring and the need for additional security measures.
Data privacy issues: As discussed in [20], AI-driven EDR systems often rely on vast amounts of data, including
private user and device information. This raises serious privacy concerns regarding the collection, storage, and use
of this data, particularly in compliance with data protection laws like the CCPA and GDPR.
Resource Intensiveness: Implementing AI in EDR solutions often requires significant computational resources,
such as processing and storage power. This may pose challenges for organizations with outdated infrastructure or
limited resources to widely adopt AI-driven EDR solutions.

7.2 Deep ocean protection system (dopes)
As per reference [4], DOPS system consists of two main parts, namely, the Endpoint Micro service and the Endpoint
Service Pack. ESP software is continuously to collect data on individual user computers. Then the data proceeds through the
REST API to the Endpoint Micro service and is stored in the database for querying. By using REST APIs, it becomes
unnecessary for user computers to be connected to the server's network, allowing DOPS to be customized for a range of
deployment scenarios. But because of its intricacy, DOPS works best in institutional environments. To map ESP queries to
the Endpoint Micro service, a gateway is sufficient for businesses that manage many APIs [4].Easy-to-use DOPS web
interface designed to monitor, and display collected data and assist administrators in establishing policies or taking prompt
action as needed. For businesses and other organizations to ensure that their clients' privacy is maintained, service, database,
and user interface security are essential.
•

Deep Ocean Malware Detector: The Deep Ocean Malware Detector(DOMD) comprises two principal components:
the Pre-processor and the Detector. The Pre-processor transforms input binaries into images before forwarding
them to the Detector for final labelling [4].

•

Image base Malware Detector: In [4] the purpose of the Image-based totally Malware Detector assignment is to
create a version that could determine if a report consists of malware or now not. In this mission, a malware
classifier is trained, and documents are then evaluated for maliciousness. Phases one and of the DOMD assignment
contain training a multiclass malware classifier to determine the circle of relatives of a selected malware pattern
and assessing the model's ability to forecast files that are recognized to be benign or malicious. One limitation of
this approach is the requirement for real-world data to effectively deploy a deep learning model. For accurate
predictions, the input data should align with what the model has been trained on. In this scenario, the model,
trained on BODMAS 3 or earlier, exclusively learns about malware classes, potentially leading to poor
performance when confronted with benign samples [4].

Furthermore, these methods represent a significant innovation compared to traditional EDRs, offering a more
comprehensive analysis of system activities by logging data from both user land and kernel land.
7.3 Extended detection & response (xdr)
Extended Detection and Response (XDR): An open cyber security architecture that brings unified security operations and
security technologies to all security layers-people, endpoints, email, networks, apps, and cloud performance and data. XDR
closes the visibility gap between security technologies and layers previously separated silos, provided overburdened security
teams with quick and easy access to effectiveness when it comes to uncovering and responding to threats. The architecture
also provides comprehensive and contextual data that is helpful to prevent the threats [19].Though initially conceptualized
in 2018, the discourse surrounding XDR among security professionals and industry analysts has rapidly evolved. While
some initially likened XDR to an enhanced version of endpoint detection and response (EDR), extending its coverage to all
enterprise security layers, today's experts recognize XDR's potential far beyond mere tool integration. They highlight its
ability to provide end-to-end threat visibility, a unified interface, and streamlined workflows for threat detections,
investigations and responses. As per [13], Extended Detection and Response (XDR) is a step up from conventional
Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) systems. It provides a number of unique benefits that solve the drawbacks of EDR
separately. Some advantages of XDR over EDR are as follows:

Comprehensive Visibility: XDR expands its reach beyond endpoints to encompass diverse data sources such as
network traffic, cloud environments, email systems, and beyond. This broader scope of visibility empowers holistic
threat detection and response throughout the entire IT infrastructure, equipping security teams with a more
thorough understanding of potential threats.
Enhanced Detection skills: XDR, unlike EDR alone, enhances threat detection capabilities by correlating and
assessing data from multiple sources. This approach reduces the likelihood of missed detections and false positives
by leveraging advanced analytics, machine learning, threat intelligence to identify complex attack patterns and
indicators of compromise across various vectors.
Faster Incident Response: XDR streamlines incident response by means of offering contextual insights into
detected threats throughout one-of-a-kind endpoints and community segments. This allows security groups to
prioritize and inspect incidents greater successfully, utilizing centralized dashboards and automated reaction
movements to unexpectedly mitigate threats and reduce the impact of security breaches.
To summarize, XDR has a lot of benefits over EDR because of greater visibility, detection competencies, incident
response efficiency, and scalability throughout the IT set. Companies that adopt an integrated method of risk
detection and response can enhance their defense posture and efficiently address numerous cyber hazard threats.

potential risks. In essence, our research promotes the adoption of Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning within EDR
solutions as a proactive and strategic approach to cybersecurity. By embracing these advancements, organizations can
reinforce their defensive capabilities and better shield against emerging cyber threats, thereby ensuring the resilience and
security of their digital infrastructure for the foreseeable future. [19-26]
